			I'm on my way to the Avenger HQ, so yeah, while I'm flying, I'll write about what's happened so far in my life and about my kingdom, Wakanda.
			Wakanda is located in Africa and his hidden from the rest of the world. People thought and some still do think that we're a land of farmers. Ha! it's amusing actually. Anyways, I'll tell you the truth, a long time ago, an asteroid struck our planet. (un)Fortunately, it was composed of a rare metal, called vibranium. It penetrated through the surface and only a little is visible on top. Since then, we decided to go into hiding and protect our little secret. After that, there was no looking back, our technological advancements cannot are unmatched and we've barely scratched the surface of the vibranium source. Also, a particular plant got affected by this asteroid and is the source of strength for the Black Panther. It's called the heart-shaped herb. It's closely guarded in the royal gardens. 
			<br>
			Anyways, time to take leave. I'll write about myself soon.
			<br>
			Wakanda Forever!

			It's been 4 days since I've been an Avenger. Yeah, that's what we call ourselves. It's cool actually. And yeah, they're always addressing me as 'your Highness'. So yeah, I'm the king of Wakanda and also the Black Panther. The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations and its mantle has passed from one warrior to another. My father, T'Chaka, was the previous Black Panther and King. After he was assassinated, I've been the protector and King of Wakanda. I enjoy the late night prowls, especially in the deeper parts of the jungle. I get to see the real black panthers and I end up having fun with them. Apart from that, I've started to learn and master the rules and regulations of governing a country and so far I've not disappointed. I want to make my nation proud and achieve the dreams of my father.

			Oh, looks like the Avengers are needed, gotta go!
			<br>
			Wakanda Forever!
